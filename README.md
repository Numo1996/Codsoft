# This repository contains three projects completed during my internship at Codsoft. Below is a brief overview of each project:
# 1. Credit Card Fault Detection
# This project involved detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transactional data, the aim was to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior and develop a model capable of flagging suspicious transactions in real-time.

# Technologies Used:
# Python
# Sklearn
# Pandas
# NumPy
# Seaborn
# matplotlib
# Key Features:
# Data preprocessing for imbalanced datasets
# Model selection and tuning
# Evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score)
# Handling class imbalance


# 2. Sales Prediction
# This project focuses on predicting sales for a given product based on historical sales data and other relevant features. The goal was to develop a model that accurately forecasts future sales, helping businesses plan their inventory and resources effectively.

# Technologies Used:
# Python
# Sklearn
# Pandas
# NumPy
# Seaborn
# matplotlib
# Key Features:
# Data preprocessing and cleaning
# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
# Model selection and training
# Evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)


# 3. Titanic survival prediction
# In this project, I worked on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as age, gender, class, etc. The objective was to build a machine learning model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.

# Technologies Used:
# Python
# Sk-learn
# Pandas
# Matplotlib
# Seaborn
# Key Features:
# Data visualization
# Feature engineering
# Model training and evaluation
